<h1> Public Domain Software System (PDSS) </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
This is a project to try to create as much of a fully public domain software system (PDSS) as possible. 
The assumption is that eventually, a fully public domain system will exist, 
from a public domain operating system to the applications running on it, comparable to popular operating
systems like Linux, Windows, or Mac, etc.

Notes

Mentions: Mention of a public domain project does not necessarily constitute approval of it or its contents,
but rather it is mentioned because it has some kind of public domain feature which may be useful
for adding to a full public domain software system.

Moderation: Maintainer of this project asks that discussions and content is kept "family friendly"
(use common sense) and reserves the right to act as "benevolent dictator" in enforcing this standard,
however cannot guarantee that this project will be heavily curated enough to always enforce such standard
consistently.
