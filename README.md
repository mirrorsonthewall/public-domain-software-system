<h1> Public Domain Software System (PDSS) </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
This is a project to try to create as much of a fully public domain software system (PDSS) as possible. 
The assumption is that eventually, a fully public domain system will exist, 
from a public domain operating system to the applications running on it, comparable to popular operating
systems like Linux, Windows, or Mac, etc.

Please see [NOTES.md](https://github.com/mirrorsonthewall/public-domain-software-system/blob/master/NOTES.md) for more project-specific rules of thumb.
